This app finds unused classes and functions in your ruby source tree.  There is a binary that takes in as the first and only argument the root of the tree.  The rails flag avoids some directories, such as vendor, when looking for definitions and usages.

As of Sept 12, 2011, things that need to be done:

- add a config file
- use rake routes to find controllers
- modules
- correctly find usages of functions of the same name

Thought:

Can we use the 'ancestors' method to travel up an object's tree and figure out where a method comes from? This would probably help reducing potential name conflicts, if two methods have the same name.

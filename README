This app finds unused classes and functions in your ruby source tree.  There is a binary that takes in as the first and only argument the root of the tree.  The rails flag avoids some directories, such as vendor, when looking for definitions and usages.

As of Aug, 11 2011, things that need to be done
add a config file
use rake routes to find controllers
search for symbol usage
modules
remove duplication from dead classes and dead functions
correctly find usages of functions of the same name
make this a gem
for rails projects, :class_name => 'X' is a usage

Known Issues:
"#"; def method; end;  thinks method is commented out.
commented out usages still count as usages
